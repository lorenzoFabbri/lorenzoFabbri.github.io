title: About me
---

My name is Lorenzo Fabbri and I currently live in San Marino, my home country. I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Biotechnology and a Master's degree in Computational Biology. My Master's internship was about the use of Machine and Deep Learning for Drug Unbinding Kinetics, whereas my Master's thesis was about the use of Machine and Deep Learning for Drug-Induced Liver Injury (DILI). More about me can be found on my [CV](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5r6keu9a7myy5as/lorenzo_fabbri_cv.pdf?dl=0).

I am currently looking for a PhD position, broadly in the fields of Exposomics and Epidemiology. I would like to apply Data Science methods to Omic, GIS and other relevant data to link environmental exposures to several diseases, including Cancer. Finally, I am interested in the impact of nutrition (with a focus on a plant-based diet) on human health and the environment.
