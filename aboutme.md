title: About me
---

My name is Lorenzo Fabbri and I currently live in San Marino, my home country. I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Biotechnology and a Master's degree in Computational Biology. My Master's internship was about the use of Machine and Deep Learning for Drug Unbinding Kinetics, whereas my Master's thesis was about the use of Machine and Deep Learning for Drug-Induced Liver Injury (DILI). More about me can be found on my [CV](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5r6keu9a7myy5as/lorenzo_fabbri_cv.pdf?dl=0).

I am currently looking for a PhD position. I would like to broadly focus in the following reseach areas: Nutritional Epidemiology, Sustainable Diets and Exposomics. More specifically, I would like to study the impacts of Plant-Based Diets on both human and planetary health. Finally, I am interested in the concept of the Human Exposome.
