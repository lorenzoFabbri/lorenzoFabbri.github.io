In this page I will add all the (more or less) personal projects I am working on.

## IoT

- [Pollution Hub based on Arduino](https://github.com/lorenzoFabbri/pollution-hub). This is a small project that uses Arduino and a series of sensors to measure air pollution. Currently, I am trying to measure both PM2.5 and PM10 using low-cost sensors. Once everything is set-up correctly, the hub will send all the measured data (e.g., pollution levels, temperature, humidity, etc...) to a small server and they will be available on-line. The tricky part is calibrating the sensors for measuring PM.
